# Stop Bloat 
<img src="./imgs/thumbnail.png"><br>
Python script designed to fascilitate the process of removing all android bloatware from a linux machine. Since not everyone has the time and patience to flash a custom rom onto their phone or even try to get the root permissions, I've decided to at least try and give them a chance to remove all/most of the bloatware (in my opinion spyware would be the suitable term) that is present on now almost every android device out there.
